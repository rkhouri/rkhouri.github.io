<div align = "justify">These days, we are absolutely drowning in data, whether it is our personal private data or open-access public data, and so much data collects proverbial dust because it is not analyzed and displayed in a way that is useful or interesting. The feeling of seeing a "good" (effective, educational, and aesthetically-pleasing) data visualization is truly satisfying. With the correct presentation, data can be approachable, accessible, and exciting! I finished my Masterâ€™s degree in Infectious Diseases and One Health in September 2023. In the months that followed, I had more downtime than I knew what to do with, and I wanted a creative outlet to keep my mind busy. I also wanted to fall in love with learning again! Data visualization is a captivating meeting point of science, art, and communication, and it felt like the perfect avenue to embark on a learning journey.</div>

### The "Slide" Imagery

<div align="justify">The design process for my site logo is explored in detail in my first blog post: <a href="https://renee.khouri.ca/2023-11-20-blog-creation/">Launching the Blog</a>. In short, I chose the image of a playground slide to to represent the process of problem-solving and learning new skills. Playing on a slide involves a sometimes-strenuous climb, followed by a rush of exhilaration as you slide down. All the effort to get to the top of the slide is forgotten immediately once you feel that rush. The joy of solving a problem or using a new skill to build something makes the climb worth it, and you cannot help running back for more with a smile on your face.</div>

### My Goal

<div align="justify">This blog is a place to experiment with data visualization, learn new techniques and tools, and practice my communication skills. I will consider this endeavour a success if I learn something new with every post and have fun while I do it. Luckily, when it comes to data, there is always something new to learn! I am experienced with <i>R</i>, and I look forward to discovering new <i>R</i> techniques, as well as learning some new languages. If anyone finds their way to this corner of the internet, please leave a comment with suggestions or helpful tips! Thanks for joining me on the playground! Let's create something captivating with data.</div>
