<div align = "justify">I finished my Masterâ€™s degree in Infectious Diseases and One Health in September 2023. In the months that followed, I had plenty of downtime, and I wanted a creative outlet to keep my mind busy. I also wanted to fall in love with learning again! These days, we are absolutely drowning in data, whether it is our personal private data or open-access public data. So much data collects proverbial dust becuase it is not analyzed and displayed in a way that is useful or interesting. Data visualization is a captivating meeting point of science, art, and communication. The feeling of seeing a good data visualization (effective, educational, and aesthetically pleasing) is truly satisfying. Most importantly, the correct presentation can make data approachable, accessible, and exciting!</div>

### My goal

<div align="justify">This blog is a place to experiment with data visualization, learn new techniques and tools, and practice my communication skills. I will consider this endevour a success if I learn something new with every post and have fun while I do it. Most of my coding background is using <i>R</i>, so there is a lot to learn. If anyone finds their way to this corner of the internet, please leave a comment with suggestions or helpful tips! Thanks for joining me on the playground! Let's make data fun.</div>
