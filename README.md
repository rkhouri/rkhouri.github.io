# Project Description
Blog dedicated to learning new data visualization tools. My motivation is to reinvigorate my love of learning by having fun with data, which is so abundantly avilable that it feels limitless and often wasted. I will use this blog to document my progress as I learn new coding, design, and data visualization skills in a self-paced environment where I can design and execute personal projects focused on how to use data in new and exciting ways!
