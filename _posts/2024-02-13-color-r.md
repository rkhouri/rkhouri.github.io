Effective data visualization requires as much art as it does science;
color choice is an important example. From manual color selection, to
basic functions, to entire packages dedicated to color, there are
multiple methods to specify the colors used in visualizations made in R.
We will explore the following:

1.  Individual colors included in base R

2.  Hexadecimal codes

3.  Color palettes included in base R

4.  Color palettes from packages

<br>

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Base R - Individual Colors

Base R defines 657 colors, which can be called by
[name](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~tzheng/files/Rcolor.pdf) or by
[number](https://r-graph-gallery.com/41-value-of-the-col-function.html).
You can print a complete list of the 657 colors in your R console using:

``` r
colors()
```

    ##   [1] "white"                "aliceblue"            "antiquewhite"        
    ##   [4] "antiquewhite1"        "antiquewhite2"        "antiquewhite3"       
    ##   [7] "antiquewhite4"        "aquamarine"           "aquamarine1"         
    ##  [10] "aquamarine2"          "aquamarine3"          "aquamarine4"         
    ##  [13] "azure"                "azure1"               "azure2"              
    ....
    ## [646] "wheat"                "wheat1"               "wheat2"              
    ## [649] "wheat3"               "wheat4"               "whitesmoke"          
    ## [652] "yellow"               "yellow1"              "yellow2"             
    ## [655] "yellow3"              "yellow4"              "yellowgreen"

<br>

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Selecting Colors by Hex Codes

The hexadecimal color system uses a 6-digit code to describe color. Red,
green, and blue are each represented by 2 digits (#rrggbb). Hex codes
allow for precise color selection, which is particularly useful when
designing visualizations that will be featured on a poster, website,
report, or digital dashboard. In this way, the plot can be easily
integrated into the overall color palette (*i.e.* by directly matching
colors used in the text, logos, header/footer accents, etc.). For
example, my site footer color is \#6038d3 and my logo uses \#6038d3 and
\#d33847, so a visualization that will be hosted on this site could use
these colors to showcase that the design was made with this site in
mind. Many companies have specific color palettes pre-selected, which
keeps company materials and presentations looking cohesive.

There are many online tools for identifying hex codes from images or
websites, and most design tools (*e.g.*,
[Canva](https://bloggingguide.com/canva-color-picker/)) include built-in
color ID tools. To find the hex code for a base R color, you can visit
this [helpful site](https://r-charts.com/colors/) or run the following
code directly in your R console.

``` r
library(dplyr)  # dplyr is required to use pipes (%>%)

col2rgb("darkorchid4") %>%
  t() %>%
  rgb(maxColorValue = 255)
```

    ## [1] "#68228B"

<br>

Assigning a single color to a base R plot using the “col” argument is
simple. The following three plots use the same color, which were be
called by different methods: name (specific to R), number (specific to
R), and hexadecimal code.

``` r
par(mfrow = c(1, 3))
plot(iris$Sepal.Length, iris$Petal.Length, col = "darkorchid4")
plot(iris$Sepal.Length, iris$Petal.Length, col = colors()[99])
plot(iris$Sepal.Length, iris$Petal.Length, col = "#68228B")
```

![](2024-02-13-color-r_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png)<!-- -->

<br>

When exploring data, it can also be helpful to use color to provide
quick explorations of the data.

``` r
plot(
  x = iris$Sepal.Length,
  y = iris$Petal.Length,
  col = ifelse(iris$Sepal.Width < 3, "gray", "darkorchid4")
  )
```

![](2024-02-13-color-r_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png)<!-- -->

<br>

However, more often than not, a visualization will require more than one
color. If have not been assigned a color palette for your project, there
are numerous pre-built color palettes to help choose complimentary
colors for your viz. However, not all palettes are created equal, so it
is worth taking the time to select a palette best suited to your task.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Base R - Color Palettes

The `grDevices` package (included in base R) defines numerous color
palettes. Possibly the most
[infamous](https://colorspace.r-forge.r-project.org/articles/endrainbow.html)
is the rainbow() palette. However, as this
[blog](https://developer.r-project.org/Blog/public/2019/04/01/hcl-based-color-palettes-in-grdevices/)
explains, RGB/HSV-based colors are more difficult for humans to perceive
than hue-chroma-luminance (HCL) colors. So, in 2019, many [HCL
palettes](https://developer.r-project.org/Blog/public/2019/04/01/hcl-based-color-palettes-in-grdevices/)
were added to `grDevices`.

Starting from any existing palette, you can create a custom palette
based on the number of colors needed. For example, creating a 3-color
palette from the “heat.colors” palette to distinguish a categorical
variable with 3 categories (*e.g.*, the species variable of the iris
dataset), as shown below. Mapping a color palette to *categorical*
variables in base R requires transforming the “variable of interest in
an integer that will be used to call the appropriate color.” Mapping a
color palette to a *continuous* variable in base R requires manually
dividing the variable of interest into bins. Plot examples adapted from
[R Graph Gallery](https://r-graph-gallery.com/13-scatter-plot.html). An
easier method for mapping a color palette to variable, using `ggplot2`,
is explored in the section [R Packages Related to
Color](#r-packages-related-to-color).

``` r
# Create a color palette with the desired number of colors
colors <- heat.colors(n = 3)

# Transform the categorial variable into integers
class <- unclass(iris$Species)
# "unclass" returns a copy of its argument with its class attribute removed
# For a categorical variable, it returns a list of integers.

# Scatterplot with each species a different color
plot(
  x = iris$Sepal.Length,
  y = iris$Petal.Length,
  bg = colors[class],
  cex = 3,
  pch = 21)
```

![](2024-02-13-color-r_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png)<!-- -->

``` r
# Create a color palette with the desired number of colors
cont_colors <- heat.colors(n = 20)

# Transform the numeric variable into bins
rank <- as.factor(as.numeric(cut(iris$Petal.Width, 20)))

# Scatterplot with color gradient
plot(
  x = iris$Sepal.Length,
  y = iris$Petal.Length,
  bg = cont_colors[rank],
  cex = 3,
  pch=21
)
```

## R Packages Related to Color

`ggplot2`

The best way to integrate color into your visuals in a compelling way is
to use `ggplot2`. Mapping a color palette to a variable is much easier
with ggplot grammar than with base R. As seen below, ggplot2
automatically assigns a color to each class of a categorical variable
without requiring the user to transform the variable.

``` r
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(data = iris, aes(x = Sepal.Length, y = Petal.Length, color = Species)) +
  geom_point(size = 5)
```

![](2024-02-13-color-r_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png)<!-- -->

<br>

When no color palette is assigned, ggplot2 uses a default palette.
However, this can be changed using a number of functions. Below, I will
demonstrate the functions housed in the `paletteer` package, though
ggplot2 can natively call other color palettes; for more information,
refer to the
[r-graph-gallery](https://r-graph-gallery.com/ggplot2-color.html) page
on the subect.

<br>

`paletteer` (by Emil Hvitfeldt).

A compilation of color palettes from numerous R packages (full list
[here](https://rdocumentation.org/packages/paletteer/versions/1.6.0)).
The latest version (v_1.6.0) compiles **2728** palettes from 75
packages. Some notable ones:

- `RcolorBrewer`, one of the most well-known collection of palettes in
  R.
- `viridis`, which includes [8 color
  palettes](https://github.com/sjmgarnier/viridis) designed with
  colorblindness/desaturation in mind.
- `grDevices`, if you want to stick with baseR palettes.

The palettes are classified as:

- Discrete (fixed width): have a set amount of colors which does not
  change even when a number of colors is requested. *E.g.*,
  “nord::frost” will always be limited to 4 colors.
- Discrete (dynamic): the colors of the palette depend on the number of
  colors required.
- Continuous: a smooth transition best for continuous variables.

Each type of palette is called by a unique function when plotting with
ggplot2:

- Discrete (fixed width):
  `scale_color_paletteer_d("packagename::palettename")`

- Discrete (dynamic):
  `scale_color_paletteer_d("packagename::palettename", dynamic = TRUE)`

- Continuous: `scale_color_paletteer_c("packagename::palettename")`

  ``` r
  library(ggplot2)
  library(paletteer)

  ggplot(data = iris, aes(x = Sepal.Length, y = Sepal.Width, color = Species)) +
    geom_point(size = 3) +
    scale_color_paletteer_d("nord::frost")
  ```

  ![](2024-02-13-color-r_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-10-1.png)<!-- -->

  ``` r
  library(ggplot2)
  library(paletteer)

  ggplot(data = iris, aes(x = Sepal.Length, y = Sepal.Width, color = Sepal.Width)) +
    geom_point(size = 3) +
    scale_color_paletteer_c("ggthemes::Orange-Blue Diverging")
  ```

  ![](2024-02-13-color-r_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-11-1.png)<!-- -->

<br>

Even more color palettes can be found in the `cpt-city`
[package](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=cptcity), which was
excluded from `paletteer` due to the sheer number of palettes
(**7140!**). The cpt-cty project is an archive of colour gradients for
cartography, technical illustration and design; the R package is
maintained by [Sergio
Ibarra-Espinosa](https://github.com/ibarraespinosa/cptcity).

`colorBlindness` (by Jianhong Ou).

This package contains several useful tools to ensure your visualizations
are accessible to viewers with euteranopia and protanopia (two forms of
red-green colorblindness). In addition, you can stimulate what your
plots will look like when desaturated, which represents viewers with
achromatopsia or if your visualizations are printed in B&W.

- Color-vision-deficiency (CVD) simulation is possible with the
  “cvdPlot” function. This function was adapted from the `colorblindr`
  package, written by Claire D. McWhite and Claus O. Wilke. Note that
  this function is only compatible with a ggplot grob, you cannot use a
  plot made with base R.

  ``` r
  library(ggplot2)
  library(paletteer)
  library(colorBlindness)

  p <- ggplot(data = iris, aes(x = Sepal.Length, y = Sepal.Width, color = Species)) +
    geom_point() +
    scale_color_paletteer_d("lisa::OskarSchlemmer")

  colorBlindness::cvdPlot(p)
  ```

  ![](2024-02-13-color-r_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-12-1.png)<!-- -->

<br>

- CVD stimulation is also possible with individual colors or colors in a
  palette with the “displayAllColors” function. In the examples below,
  note how much better the viridis palette performs when desaturated,
  compared to the rainbow palette.

  ``` r
  library(paletteer)
  library(colorBlindness)

  colorBlindness::displayAllColors(rainbow(n = 10))
  ```

  ![](2024-02-13-color-r_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-13-1.png)<!-- -->

  ``` r
  colorBlindness::displayAllColors(paletteer_c("viridis::inferno", n = 10))
  ```

  ![](2024-02-13-color-r_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-13-2.png)<!-- -->

<br>

- You can also use this package to correct your colors and replace them
  with more accessible choices if needed. Again, this will only work
  with ggplot grobs or a selection of colors.

  ``` r
  p <- ggplot(data = iris, aes(x = Sepal.Length, y = Sepal.Width, color = Species)) +
    geom_point() +
    scale_color_paletteer_d("lisa::OskarSchlemmer")

  cvdPlot(p)
  ```

  ![](2024-02-13-color-r_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-14-1.png)<!-- -->

  ``` r
  cvdPlot(replacePlotColor(p))
  ```

  ![](2024-02-13-color-r_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-14-2.png)<!-- -->

<br>

## General Considerations for Color in Data Viz

- **Keep colors consistent**. If you are creating multiple plots using
  the same data groupings, make sure that groups are always represented
  by the same colors. This avoids confusion for readers, especially if
  they are not paying close attention to the text of the labels.
- **Accommodate for colorblind viewers**. Commonly, research style
  guides will advise avoiding red and green in the same figure. While
  this is a starting point, it does not garuntee that your
  visualizations will be acessible. My preferred tool is the
  `colorBlindness` package in R, which is described in the section [R
  Packages Related to Color](#r-packages-related-to-color).
- **Don’t go overboard**. Colors are a tool to help distinguish groups
  or sections of your graph. They should not be overused to the point of
  overwhelming your viewers or making your plots appear unprofessional.
  Not everything needs an eye-catching color; some figure features
  (*e.g.*, titles, labels, grid lines) are better left black.
- **Some colors carry social connotations**. For example, if displaying
  monetary values or profits in a figure, it’s important to remember
  that most people will interpret red as a negative or a loss, so avoid
  using red to denote the positive end of your scale. In addition, if
  you are making a comparison, avoid colors that imply “good” or “bad.”
  For example, when comparing the efficacy of two products, if you make
  data points from one product red, it could lead viewers to interpret
  that product as bad, harmful, or less useful, even if the data does
  not support this opinion.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

<br>

## Summary

In R, individual colors can be called by name, number, or hexadecimal
code. Thousands of color palettes exist, some of which are avialble in
base R, but most can be found in the `paletter` package. Though changing
the color of plots with base R is possible, the process is more
efficient and flexible with the use of `ggplot2`. There are also useful
packages, such as `colorBlindness` that can be used to ensure your
figures are accessible to colorblind viewers. The most effective color
choice will depend on the purpose of the visualization and the type of
data. For example, choosing between a discrete or continuous palette
will depend on the type of data you are visualizing. Colors help engage
viewers and make visual data easier to comprehend.

### Learning Roundup

Though I was familiar with all of the tools described in this post,
finding resources to link to this post ended up teaching me several new
tricks. For example, I discovered the cvdPlot funciton in the
`colorBlindness` package, which can be used to simulate
color-vision-deficiency of finished plots. Until now, I had only used
the package to see if my color selections were distinguishable to
colorblind viewers, but seeing the final plots actually makes it much
easier to know how readable or unreadable the plots would be.

On a more general note, I wanted to truncate the lengthy output of an
rmd chunk, which led me to the [rmarkdown
cookbook](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/hook-truncate.html),
where I learned how to edit the default knittr hook. The resulting code
can be found in the rmd document used to created this page, found in my
GitHub [repository](https://rkhouri.github.io/assets/).
